# Mintyn iOS Task Solution

## Overview

I've implemented the Mintyn Digital Bank app with a focus on recreating the login, home, and settings screens as requested. The implementation follows UIKit best practices, with clean architecture principles, proper view abstractions, and attention to design details.

## Completed Features

- **Welcome Screen**
  - Styled exactly as per design with correct white/gray color separation
  - Bottom sheet with properly rounded corners 
  - Animated bottom sheet appearance
  - Login and Create Account buttons with proper styling

- **Login Screen**
  - Header with feature cards in two swipeable pages with page indicator
  - Phone number field
  - Password field with visibility toggle
  - Remember Me checkbox
  - Footer with version information

- **Home Screen**
  - Account balance card with eye toggle for balance visibility
  - Quick Actions section with horizontally scrolling cards
  - Account section with horizontally scrolling cards
  - Recent Transactions list with categorized items

- **Settings Screen**
  - Basic implementation with system, legal and logout functionalities

- **Main Tab Bar**
  - Navigation between Home, Cards, History, and Settings tabs

## With More Time, I Could Have Done the Following:

### Code Refactors

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Fully implement MVVM architecture across all screens
   - Refactor view controllers to have distinct data sources and delegates
   - Create view models for all screens with proper unit tests

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Create a comprehensive UI component library
   - Design consistent reusable interfaces for cards, inputs, and buttons
   - Develop a custom bottom sheet implementation for reuse

3. **Network Layer**
   - Implement a robust networking layer with proper error handling
   - Create API service protocols for clean dependency injection 
   - Add mock services for testing and development
     
4.  **UI Screens**
   - Unable to complete the UI screens for Home and Settings to visualize what I did because of the inability to register on the app.

### Code Organization

1. **Project Structure**
   - Reorganize using feature-based organization
   - Create a clear separation between UI and business logic
   - Implement a coordinator pattern for navigation management

2. **Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive code documentation
   - Create a style guide for UI components
   - Document architecture decisions and patterns

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add snapshot tests for UI components
   - Implement integration tests for screen flows
   - Create BDD-style tests for user journeys

### Enhancements

1. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add dynamic type support
   - Implement VoiceOver support
   - Ensure proper color contrast for all elements

2. **Animation and Polish**
   - Add micro-interactions for better user experience
   - Implement transitions between screens
   - Polish tab bar selection and navigation

3. **Additional Features**
   - Complete the create account flow
   - Implement biometric authentication
   - Add proper form validation
   - Create a comprehensive transaction detail view
   - Implement search and filtering for transactions

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement cell reuse strategies for collection views
   - Optimize layout calculations and rendering

5. **Error Handling**
   - Create a unified error handling system
   - Implement graceful degradation for network failures
   - Add proper loading states and retry mechanisms

## Conclusion

The current implementation focuses on recreating the core UI and navigation as specified in the task, with attention to visual details and user interactions. With additional time, I would enhance the architecture, improve code organization, implement comprehensive testing, and add features to create a production-ready banking application.

The implemented solution demonstrates my ability to create pixel-perfect UIs with proper attention to design details, while maintaining clean and maintainable code structure. I've followed iOS development best practices and created a solid foundation that could be extended into a full-featured application.
